# HerVoice Application Blueprint

## Overview

HerVoice is a web application designed to empower and support individuals facing online harassment and threats. The application provides a secure and user-friendly platform to report incidents, access legal and emotional support resources, and track the status of their case.

## Implemented Features

*   **Navigation Bar:** A responsive navigation bar with links to Home, Case Status, Legal Toolkit, and Emotional Support. The "Home" button now resets the application to the initial state.
*   **User Authentication Flow:** A user authentication flow that begins when the user clicks the "Get Started" button. The user is presented with a login form and the option to create an account.
*   **Sign-up Form:** A sign-up form that collects the user's first name, last name, email, password, and phone number.
*   **Hero Section:** A compelling hero section with a brief introduction to the application and a call to action to "Get Started."
*   **Multi-step Reporting Form:** A multi-step form to report incidents, including details about the threat, the suspect, and the ability to upload evidence.
*   **Component-based Architecture:** The application is built using a component-based architecture with React, making it modular and maintainable.
*   **Routing:** The application uses `react-router-dom` for routing, allowing for a seamless single-page application experience.
*   **Styling:** The application uses a combination of CSS and a component-specific styling approach to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
*   **Linting:** The application uses ESLint to enforce code quality and consistency.
*   **Prop-types:** The application uses `prop-types` to validate the props passed to each component.

## Current State

The application is in a stable state with the core features implemented. The user authentication flow has been added, and the application is ready for Firebase integration. All linting errors have been resolved.
